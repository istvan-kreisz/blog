An online multiplayer game inspired by the popular geography quiz game [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). In **Hide & Seek World** you're up against 2-19 players and your playground is the world map. In each turn someone "hides" somewhere by selecting a (Google) Street View location. The other players have to locate the hider based on the Street View image. The closer your guess is to the actual location the more points you get. I built the frontend with **Next.js** and **React** and the backend with **Google Cloud Functions**. It has a premium membership option and payments are processed with **Stripe**.

Hide & Seek World has been under active development **since June 2020** and it has **hundreds of daily users**. Last year another developer & designer joined me, so currently it's a 2 person project.
