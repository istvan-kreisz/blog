Admittedly a very silly side project but it was built in only a few hours and I had a lot of fun making it! Despite its small size it uses a few interesting technologies: **Scraper API** to scrape a website and get the stock data, [Lambda Store](https://lambda.store/) a simple serverless database for Redis and **Vercel** serverless functions to provide the JSON api for the site. As my other web projects it was built with my frameworks of choice **React** and **Next.js**. This project is also a good demonstration of how easy it is to develop websites with a simple backend and database with the right usage of modern tools.
