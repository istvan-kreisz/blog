I developed a **game guide AI chatbot** using **OpenAI, LangChain, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase and Google Cloud functions**. Currently the chatbot can only answer questions about the popular game, Skyrim. The **training data for the bot is scraped** from the largest Skyrim wiki website, and stored in **a vector database**.
