My first try at building a web app. Prio is a full-featured todo list app that has both web and iOS (no longer available) components, and the two sync together in real time, thanks to **Firebase FireStore**. It was built using **vanilla Javascript** without the use of any frontend framework, using **web components** and **Firebase** services under the hood.
