**CopDeck** is one of my most ambitious projects to date. It's a sneaker inventory manager and price comparison app with lots of built-in features. The backend is built wih **Google Cloud** technologies and the price comparison data is gathered by **web scraping**. The [landing page](https://copdeck.com) is built with **React, TypeScript, Next.js** and **Tailwind**. The project also included a **Google Chrome extension** and desktop app built with **Electron** (they are no longer publicly available).
