I developed a **sneaker price comparison and inventory management iOS app** for sneaker resellers that included a web scraping algorithm using **Google Cloud, back-end**, and the [CopDeck landing page](https://copdeck.com) built with **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind and Netlify** and a desktop app built with **Electron**.
