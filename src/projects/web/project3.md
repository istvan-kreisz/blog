An online multiplayer game inspired by the popular geography quiz game [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). In **Hide & Seek World** you're up against 2-5 players and your playground is the world map. In each turn someone "hides" somewhere by selecting a (Google) Street View location. The other players have to locate the hider based on the Street View image. The closer your guess is to the actual location the more points you get. The frontend was built with **Next.js** and **React**, the backend is built with **Google Cloud Functions**.
