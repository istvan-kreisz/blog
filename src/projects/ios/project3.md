The iOS component of my cross platform pet project [Prio](https://prio-landing.firebaseapp.com/).
Prio is a full-featured todo list app that has both web and iOS components, and the two sync together in real time, thanks to Firebase FireStore. It is also the first app I wrote using Apple's new UI framework [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).
