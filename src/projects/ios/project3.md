LabTwin was a niche **digital assistant for pharmaceutical industry scientists** used to improve productivity by reducing note-taking. I joined LabTwinâ€™s iOS team during a scale-up with development focused on the persistence layer, new features and screens, and contribution to **CI pipelines and unit testing**. I wrote automated tests in **XCTest, Fastlane, and CircleCI** that eliminated database migration issues, integrated **AWS Amplify for user authentication**. I **developed scalable persistence layer using Realm** and UI components in UIKit and **built synchronization module using Realm, custom code, and REST APIs** to keep local data in sync with the server.
