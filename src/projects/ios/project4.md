I worked as an iOS developer for the Boston-based ecommerce startup, **SidelineSwap**. It was a great learning experience, where I started as part of a 2 person team and later fully took over the development of the application. My work mostly consisted of modernizing the UI of the application, improving the software architecture of the codebase as well as refactoring and bug fixing legacy code.
