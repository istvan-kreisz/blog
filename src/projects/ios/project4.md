SidelineSwap is an **e-commerce store** for used sporting goods. I was hired to execute a revamp of the companyâ€™s iOS app including UX on all existing screens and new features. I **improved the software architecture** by implementing the **MVVM-C** pattern, modernized the app UI, refactored and performed bug fixes in legacy code and **rebuilt the payment checkout flow**.
