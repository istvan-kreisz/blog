Vivid is one of my freelance projects. The app is an AI image generator app with lots of preset styles and a public feed where you can browse through AI art created by other users. I built the app using **SwiftUI and MVVM-C architecture**. The app also uses **Firebase Authentication** for all auth functionality. The images are generated using **Stable Diffusion** on a **serverless backend running on Google Cloud**. The generated images are stored in **Firebase Storage**. The backend is a collection of **Cloud Functions** written in **TypeScript**.
