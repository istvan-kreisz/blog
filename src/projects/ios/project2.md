In 2018 I co-founded the company called **Snake Bacon** in Austin, TX with two former classmates from college. I led the development of the iOS game **Ball Smasher**. We ended up making a publishing deal with [Lion Studios](https://lionstudios.cc), who took care of the advertising side of things. It has been downloaded more than **7 million times** and once hold the **#2 position** on the US App Store in the Free Games category.
