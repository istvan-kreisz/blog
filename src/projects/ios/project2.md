Soon after college I **co-founded** Snake Bacon, which was a **video game company** that developed Ball Smasher for iOS. I partnered with two friends to develop and launch the Ball Smasher game for iOS monetized with in-app purchases. I developed game engine code using **SpriteKit**. We negotiated a revenue share agreement with [Lion Studios](https://lionstudios.cc) for publishing and marketing the game, after which the app reached top of iOS App Store charts, achieving **>7M downloads and 4.5/5 rating from >64K reviews**.
