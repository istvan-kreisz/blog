I worked for **LabTwin**, a Berlin based startup as an iOS developer. We were creating a **voice powered lab assistant** that helps scientists take notes, follow protocols and look up information in a hands free way. I was part of a 3 member iOS development team and I took part in various aspects of app development, including: migrating our **offline data storage** system from [UserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) to a more scalable one ([Realm](https://realm.io/)), setting up **CI workflows**, writing **Unit & UI tests**, building a silent **push notification based syncing solution** to always keep data up to date with the server, integrating **user authentication using AWS** frameworks, improving the scalability of our **app architecture** etc.
