My first foray into building a consumer product from the ground up. **CopDeck** is a product built and designed entirely by me, including the [landing page](https://copdeck.com), the [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1561567080), the entire backend (which relies heavily on web-scraping), and even a desktop app built with Electron (not available anymore). CopDeck is a sneaker inventory managager and price comparison app. As a business it didn't work out, due to various reasons but it was an extremely exciting challenge as a developer, which made me confident that I can build all aspects of a complex product from zero.
